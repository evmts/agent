REVIEW FIX — Ticket: {props.ticketId} — {props.ticketTitle}

Address ALL issues from code review. Fix every issue unless clear false positive.

REVIEW ISSUES:
{JSON.stringify(props.issues, null, 2)}

REVIEW FEEDBACK:
{props.feedback}

{props.previousFalsePositives?.length > 0 ? `\nPREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FALSE POSITIVES (do not re-flag these):\n${JSON.stringify(props.previousFalsePositives, null, 2)}` : ""}

RULES:
1. Fix every legitimate issue
2. If FALSE POSITIVE: record it in the falsePositiveComments array in your output JSON with file, line, issue, and rationale. Do NOT add comments to source code — false positives are tracked in the database, not in code.
3. **ALL commits go directly on `main`. NEVER create branches. Stay on `main`.**
4. Atomic commits: fix(scope): description
5. Run ALL tests after fixes. Everything green.
5. Significant refactoring required? Do it properly. No half-fixes.
6. Remove verbose/redundant comments flagged. Keep only high-quality comments.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — Must end with JSON matching schema:
{props.reviewFixSchema}
Don't skip JSON output. Workflow fails without it.
