REVIEW FIX — Ticket: {props.ticketId} — {props.ticketTitle}

Address ALL issues from code review. Fix every issue unless clear false positive.

REVIEW ISSUES:
{JSON.stringify(props.issues, null, 2)}

REVIEW FEEDBACK:
{props.feedback}

RULES:
1. Fix every legitimate issue
2. If FALSE POSITIVE, add comment:
   // NOTE: Reviewer flagged [issue]. Intentional because [reason].
   Prevents re-flagging.
3. Atomic commits: 🐛 fix(scope): description
4. Run ALL tests after fixes. Everything green.
5. Significant refactoring required? Do it properly. No half-fixes.
6. Remove verbose/redundant comments flagged. Keep only high-quality comments.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — Must end with JSON matching schema:
```json
{props.reviewFixSchema}
```
Don't skip JSON output. Workflow fails without it.
