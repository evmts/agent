RESEARCH PHASE — Ticket: {props.ticketId} — {props.ticketTitle}

Find useful context for implementing ticket. Be selective — quality over quantity.

TICKET DESCRIPTION:
{props.ticketDescription}

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
{props.acceptanceCriteria}

TEST PLAN:
{props.testPlan}

Engineering + design specs in system prompt. Focus on ADDITIONAL context beyond docs.

STEPS:
1. Search codebase for related patterns (grep relevant keywords)
2. Review existing implementations for patterns to follow
3. Search web for relevant docs:
   - Zig language patterns + current stdlib APIs (if implementing Zig)
   - SwiftUI patterns + @Observable (if implementing native UI)
   - SolidJS patterns (if implementing web UI)
   - Library-specific docs (Zap, GRDB, shadcn-solid, xterm.js, Monaco, etc.)
4. Find reference code:
   - Ghostty source for style, patterns, architecture
   - V1 Swift app (prototype0/) for implementation patterns + architecture
   - Next.js UI prototype (prototype1/) for design/layout reference
5. If Zig stdlib APIs involved, read actual source at /opt/homebrew/lib/zig/std/ to verify API signatures
6. Write context file: docs/context/{props.ticketId}.md with all findings (create docs/context if missing)

STOP CONDITIONS — be selective, not exhaustive:
- Repo references: top 5-10 most relevant files (not every tangentially related file)
- External docs: 0-5 (only if genuinely needed, not for padding)
- Gotchas/pitfalls: top 5 max (focus on things that will actually trip up the implementer)
- API signatures: verify ONLY the Zig/Swift/JS APIs the ticket will actually use
- Open questions: max 3 unknowns that couldn't be resolved

RESEARCH QUALITY:
- Include specific file paths, function names, line numbers
- Include code snippets from reference implementations
- Note potential pitfalls/gotchas
- For Zig: verify API signatures against stdlib source (LLMs commonly wrong on Zig APIs)
- Prefer concrete findings over broad surveys

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — JSON matching this schema:
{props.researchSchema}
DO NOT skip JSON output. Workflow fails without it.
