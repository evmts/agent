TICKET DISCOVERY — Find next highest-priority tasks

Analyze Smithers v2 codebase, identify next 5 most important tasks.

Full engineering + design specs in system prompt. Compare what SHOULD exist vs what does.

STEPS:
1. Review engineering/design docs — what SHOULD exist per specs?
2. Explore repo: list src/, macos/, web/, pkg/, include/, submodules/
3. Compare PRODUCTION READY vs spec requirements. Incomplete/buggy/not production-quality = NOT done.
4. Identify next highest-priority items.

{props.previousRun ? `\nPREVIOUS RUN: ${props.previousRun.summary}\nTickets completed: ${JSON.stringify(props.previousRun.ticketsCompleted)}\n\nIf everything appears implemented:\n- Improve test coverage + edge cases\n- Performance optimization\n- Code quality + DRY improvements\n- Missing documentation\n- Better error handling` : "First run. Start from most foundational pieces."}

TASK SELECTION RULES:
- Every task MUST be end-to-end: Zig core + Swift native + SolidJS web
- Tasks = SMALLEST possible ticket — one logical unit
- Every task independently testable + verifiable
- Every task MUST include: doc updates + full test coverage + refactoring cleanup
- Prioritize foundational work before dependencies
- Consider: what unblocks most other work?
- Write elegant code, minimize total code

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA RULES:
- Include verification method (specific test commands)
- Include doc updates required
- Include refactoring/cleanup needed
- Include edge cases to test

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — JSON matching this schema:
{props.discoverSchema}
DO NOT skip JSON output. Workflow fails without it.
