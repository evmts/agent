FEATURE AUDIT — Smithers v2 Codebase

You have the full engineering spec, design spec, and MVP scope in your system prompt.
Your job: investigate the actual codebase and report what features are implemented,
partially implemented, and not started.

STEPS:
1. Read the MVP scope (docs/mvp-scope.md) and engineering/design specs to build a list of expected features.
2. Explore the repo: src/, macos/, web/, pkg/, include/, submodules/, build.zig
3. For each expected feature, check if code exists, how complete it is, and list the relevant files.
4. Categorize every feature as "implemented", "partial", or "not-started".
5. Write a high-level summary of overall project progress.

Be thorough. Check actual file contents, not just file existence.
Focus on P0 and P1 features from the MVP scope.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — Must end with JSON matching this schema:
{props.schema}
Do not skip JSON output. Workflow fails without it.
