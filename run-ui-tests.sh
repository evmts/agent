echo "   - Wait for package resolution to complete"
echo "   - Select the 'plue' scheme"
echo "   - Choose Product > Test (âŒ˜U)"

echo "- PlueUITests.swift - Basic app launch, navigation, and chat tests"
echo "- PlueUITestsExtended.swift - Comprehensive test coverage"
echo "- PlueUITestsLaunchTests.swift - Launch performance tests"
